<!-- Usernames -->
## Usernames
I go by a few usernames online. They're almost always one of the following:
- imTCA
- tcatechofficial
- officiallyTCA

<!-- Typeface -->
## Typeface/Font
When I need a font, I usually pick [Dosis.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dosis) I may use other fonts here and there (especially default system fonts) but I try to be consistent.
