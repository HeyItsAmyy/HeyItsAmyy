<h1 align="center">A Simple Guide To My Branding</h1>

<!-- Usernames -->
## Usernames
I go by a few usernames online. They're almost always one of the following:
- Not TCA
- imTCA
- tcatechofficial
- officiallyTCA

<!-- Typeface -->
## Typeface/Font
When I need a font, I usually pick [Dosis,](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dosis) specifically the **Bold** version. I may use other fonts here and there (especially default system fonts) but I try to be consistent.

<!-- Colors -->
## Colors
Here are the main colors I use.
- ![Yellow](./colors/yellow.jpg?raw=true) Yellow (#fffb00)
- ![Green](./colors/green.jpg?raw=true) Green (#4cff00)
- ![White](./colors/white.jpg?raw=true) White (#ffffff)
- ![Black](./colors/black.jpg?raw=true) Black (#000000)

<!-- Gradient -->
## Gradient
This is an example as to what a gradient between the yellow and green may look like. **The yellow is placed at 10%** but honestly, I just do what looks good depending on the situation.

<!-- Character -->
## Character
The character that I use the most is by <span>[its _Midnight.](https://youtube.com/c/ItsMidnight)</span> You may notice that it's tail is a socket. This is a reference to my tech-branded YouTube channel, [TCA Tech.](https://youtube.com/c/TCATech)

The other character that you can see on my socials such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/imTCA_) is Klee. Below is an image of her. Isn't she cute?

And that's it! I'll add more things here once my brand improves. Hope you have a good rest of your day!
